# Learning In Public - A Go-Based Blog

##  What it is
I'm building this blog to share my learning of golang and other technologies in public. I wanted to learn more about web development with Go (I know not the most popular). This is mainly a place for me to start writing and share those writings with other people.

## Learning Goals:

### General / Why:
1. Learning how to write better.
    - I think that writing is one of the most important skills someone can have. I think that the way someone writes is the best way to see how they think

### What I'm Learning From This App
1. Learning more about Go and HTMX
    - HTMX is one of the hot new things and interesting to have server-side rendering of your html. Does it make things faster? Who knows!
2. Learning more about how to build an MVP and iterate on a project. Trying to get better at planning and creating new things from scratch and evolving them over time

## Tech Stack
1. Go -- I want to get better at Go and be a Gopher
2. Templ -- Learn more about templated UI systems. I have some knowledge in JS so why not MORE GO
3. HTMX -- Server-side rendering is a cool thing. Only send HTML over the internet

## Features (v1 Scope)
1. Visitors can see the home page and click on a blog to retrieve the full, rendered markdown
2. Visitors can scroll through previous blog posts
3. The owner will be able to create new blog posts by adding a file to the server (SFTP)

## Future Ideas
1. SQLite DB (If I want comments or something)
2. Typst support (instead of markdown)
3. Portfolio page with Github api integration

## Setup and Running
