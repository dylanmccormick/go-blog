# That Time I Spent 4 Hours Debugging a Typo

## The Scene

It's 2 PM on a Tuesday. My code doesn't work. It SHOULD work. Everything looks right. The logic is sound. The tests pass (well, most of them). But something is wrong.

## The Investigation

I did what any reasonable developer would do:

- Added print statements everywhere
- Questioned my career choices
- Made coffee
- Googled the error message
- Read 47 Stack Overflow answers
- Made more coffee
- Considered becoming a farmer instead

## The Problem

After 4 hours of intense investigation, I found it. A single character. ONE CHARACTER.

I had typed `=` instead of `==`.

That's it. That was the bug.

## The Stages of Grief

1. **Denial** - "No way that's the issue, I checked that already"
2. **Anger** - *intense staring at screen*
3. **Bargaining** - "Maybe if I restart my computer..."
4. **Depression** - "I'm a fraud and everyone knows it"
5. **Acceptance** - "You know what, I learned something today" (I did not)

## Lessons Learned

- Use a linter
- Take breaks
- Maybe don't program at 2 PM
- Coffee doesn't solve problems but it makes you feel productive while not solving them
- We've all been there, and we'll all be there again

## Conclusion

Debugging is humbling. Typos are humiliating. But shipping working code? That's worth the occasional 4-hour spiral into self-doubt.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner who spent way too long debugging something silly. You're in good company.
