# My Extremely Important Coffee Opinions

## The Setup

I need to get this off my chest: I have opinions about coffee. Strong opinions. Caffeinated opinions, if you will.

## The Ranking (Fight Me)

Here's my definitive, completely objective ranking of coffee drinks:

1. **Pour over** - The sophisticated choice. Makes you feel like a chemist.
2. **French press** - Bold, strong, occasionally gritty. Like life.
3. **Espresso** - Tiny cup, big attitude. Respect.
4. **Cold brew** - For when you want to feel fancy but it's too hot outside.
5. **Drip coffee** - Reliable. The Honda CR-V of coffee drinks.
6. **Instant coffee** - We don't talk about instant coffee.

## The Hot Take

Pumpkin spice lattes are actually good, and I'm tired of pretending they're not. There, I said it. It's a dessert in a cup and sometimes that's exactly what you need.

## Conclusion

Life's too short for bad coffee. But also, life's too short to be a coffee snob about it. Drink what makes you happy. Unless it's instant coffee. Then we need to talk.

P.S. - If you microwave coffee, I can't help you. That's between you and your conscience.
